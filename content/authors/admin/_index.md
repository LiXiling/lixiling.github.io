#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Maximilian Xiling Li is a PhD Researcher at the [Intuitive Robots Lab](https://www.irl.iar.kit.edu/) under supervision of [TT.-Prof. Rudolf Lioutikov](https://rudolf.intuitive-robots.net/). Max's Research interests revolve around explainable artifical intelligence (XAI) for robotics. His works aims at making the decision processes of embodied AI transparent to improve human robot interaction and enhance its safety.

Previously, Max was a Research Assistant at the [Autonomous Learning Robots](https://www.alr.iar.kit.edu/) group and the [Human-Centered Systems Lab](https://h-lab.win.kit.edu/) at KIT. Before he joined KIT as a Master's Student, Max was part of a research team at SAP as a working student.
